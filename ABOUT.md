# Quem sou eu e para que é este blog?
<p></p>

Hello! I my name António Costa, student of Arts and Multimedia. I'm not very sociable, I do not consider myself nice, but there are those who say yes, anyway ... There are fools everywhere!

Speaking of fools, this blog exists for the purpose of serving as a archive and journal for my final project, but I'm not a very organized person. Besides being dyslexic, I'm probably demented, hence the theme of my project: The "image", image as an visual object.
